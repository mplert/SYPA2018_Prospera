                This portion of the study used a survey that asked a sample of graduates from Prospera about their job market outcomes.
                <br><br>
                Transfers increase with each grade level completed, and amounts awarded
                to each grade level increase annually at a rate greater than inflation. Therefore,
                total transfers that accrue to a household while a young adult was enrolled in the program varied
                with the birth years and genders of the young adult their siblings. The study focused only on the young adult's older siblings, because it was
                most interested in transfers to households when they were small children and because the young adults and their older siblings
                in the available survey were all born before the Prospera program began.
                <br><br>
                Age structure of the young adults and their older siblings in the available data is not affected by the program
                and does not affect labor market outcomes later in life. Based on this, age structure of older siblings can be used
                to measure how additional transfers impact wages and probability of formal employment.
                <br><br>
                This analysis shows find that a 1% increase in transfers increase salary of first job by 0.86% and salary of current job by 0.95%.
                This finding is significant at the 5% level.
                Additionally, a 1% increases probability of formal employment in first job 0.14% and of current job by 0.19%.
                These findings are significant at the 1% level. We do not find any affect of additional transfers on probability of being employed.
                <br><br>
                These findings are consistent with
                <a class="main-text" target="_blank"  href="https://doi.org/10.3386/w24248">previous </a>
                <a class="main-text" target="_blank"  href="https://doi.org/10.3386/w24303"> studies </a>, which used birth cohorts and census data to show that exposure to Propsera increased
                probabilituy of being as well as salaries.

                These estimates were derived by constructing a measure of the total transfers that would
                accrue to a young adult and their older siblings based on their birth years and genders, assuming all of the siblings had perfect
                school and health visit attendance records. To estimate the effect of transfers on salaries of first and current jobs
                an OLS model is used to regress monthly salary on this constructed transfer amount.
                Dummy variables for all possible numbers of older male and female siblings are included,
                as well as controls for other household and youth characteristics (household size, age, gender, currently being enrolled in
                school, years of schooling, whether the youth has ever migrated within Mexico or to the US, and state fixed effects).
                By controlling for the number of older male and female siblings and the youth’s birth year, the total transfer amount is
                left to vary only in terms of older siblings’ birth years—the source of variation exploited in this model.
                We use an OLS model to examine the effect on salary.
                To estimate the effects of transfers on the binary outcome of having a formal labor contract
                the same specification is implimented using a logit model. To interpret the results, we calculate the marginal
                effect of additional transfers at the means of all variables in the model. <a class="big-para" href="ref.html">Data </a>

                and Encuesta de Caracteristicas Socioeconomicas de los Hogares. More details on the analysis are available
