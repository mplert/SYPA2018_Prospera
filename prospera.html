                formerly known as Progresa and Oportunidades, is one of the signature programs of the Mexican social sector. First piloted in 1997 and implemented nationwide in 2000-2001, the program provides cash and transfers to poor households, conditional on children's school attendance and participation in basic nutrition and health visits. Families receive a monthly cash transfers for nutrition that do not vary with household size, conditional on health visit attendance; monthly scholarship transfers for each child that vary with child’s grade level and gender, conditional on school attendance; annual school supply transfers for each child; and, in some cases, periodic in kind nutritional supplements.

                The Prospera program has been evidence and impact driven since its earliest days. Initial pilots of the program in 1997 were randomly staggered at the locality level, to allow program effects to be rigorously tested.  A group of “treatment'” localities was enrolled in 1997, while enrollment for a group of “control” localities was delayed until 1999. A sample of households in both sets of localities were surveyed regularly during this period and afterwards to allow for the use of difference in differences estimation of program impacts.

                <br>
                Results from the earliest of these evaluations showed that household consumption increased by 15% among treated households, and that the majority of this increase was spent on increased consumption of food items
                (<a class="main-text" href="http://www.ifpri.org/publication/impact-progresa-consumption">Hoddinott, 2000, pg. iv-vi</a>).
                Other evaluations documented significant effects on health, including higher birth weights
                (<a class="main-text" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2846434/">Barber and Gertler, 2008, pg. 1405</a>),
                increased demand for health services
                (<a class="main-text" href="http://www.ifpri.org/publication/impact-progresa-health">Gertler, 2000, pg. 12</a>)
                and reduced rates of childhood stunting
                (<a class="main-text" href="https://ageconsearch.umn.edu/bitstream/16387/1/fc010104.pdf">Behrman and Hoddinott, 2001, pg. iii</a>).
                Estimates of effects on primary school enrollment were small, with the program causing around a 1 percentage point increase for both boys and girls. Impacts on secondary school enrollment were larger, with increases of 11% documented for girls and 7.5% documented for boys
                (<a class="main-text" href="https://www.brookings.edu/book/good-intentions-bad-outcomes/">Levy, 2006, pg. 59</a>).
                <br>
                <br>
                Researchers continued to exploit the randomized roll out to measure medium-term program. Later studies found that that treated students had 0.2 more years of schooling, a lower probability of being married before 21
                (<a class="main-text" href="https://ideas.repec.org/p/got/iaidps/122.html">Behrman et al 2005, pg.1-2</a>),
                better scores on cognitive and vocabulary tests, and fewer behavior problems in school
                (<a class="main-text" href="http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140673609616767/abstract">Fernald, 2009, pg. 1997</a>).
                However, these same studies found no impact on standardized test scores
                (<a class="main-text" href="https://ideas.repec.org/p/got/iaidps/122.html">Behrman et al, 2005, pg. 2</a>).
                This could be due to the overall poor quality of schools in Mexico, particularly the schools for poor children in rural areas.
